## General Information
Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss
(called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender 
when the borrower refusesto pay or runs away with the money owed.  

The main objective is to be able to identify these risky loan applicants, 
then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.   

Perform an analysis to understand the driving factors (or driver variables)
behind loan default, i.e.the variables which are strong indicators of default.  
The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment

We are using the loan.csv file and data_dictionary to understand what each column signifies.

## Technologies Used

2. Jupyter nootbook 

## Approch of Analysis

2. Univariate Analysis and Segemented Univariate Analysis
3. Bivaraiate/Multivariate Analysis
4. Results

## Conclusions
1. The people who has taken loans for any purpose in high interest rate are more likely to fall under defaulter list. 
2. Higher DTI (debt to income ratio) suggests higher chance of default.
